This is a brief `README.md` file for the `SearchEngine` GitHub repository. Since the repository content was not accessible for specific details, the description is based on common features of a software search engine project.

The screenshot section uses standard GitHub Markdown syntax to link to files assumed to be inside the `screenshots` folder. You may need to adjust the image file names (`search_interface.png`, etc.) to match the actual files in your directory.

# SearchEngine ðŸ”Ž

## Project Overview
This repository contains a custom implementation of a **Search Engine**. The project is designed to demonstrate the fundamental processes of information retrieval, including **web crawling/data collection**, **indexing**, **query processing**, and **ranking** results by relevance.

The engine aims to provide a functional example of how documents are collected, structured into an inverted index, and served to a user via a simple interface.

---

## Key Features
* **Data Acquisition:** A crawler or script to ingest data from specified sources (webpages, files, etc.).
* **Inverted Indexing:** Creation of an efficient data structure for fast term lookup.
* **Relevance Ranking:** An algorithm (such as TF-IDF or a variation of PageRank) to score and order search results.
* **Query Interface:** A simple web-based or command-line tool for users to input search queries.

---

## Technologies Used
*(Placeholder: Update this section with your actual tech stack)*
* **Backend:** Python / Java / Node.js
* **Database:** SQLite / MongoDB
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, (e.g., Flask/Django/Express template engine)
